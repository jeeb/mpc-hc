1) The x64 build has performance issues. They might be related to MMX/MMX2 being disabled for x64.
   Using the following sample, the 32bit mpc-hc build gets 62fps while the x64 gets 33fps on a i7-2600K.

2) Fix libmingwex.a x64 patch for v2.0 and use that
3) See why there are seeking problems on XP when using w32threads
4) Use vanilla ffmpeg or libav with the DXVA patches only
