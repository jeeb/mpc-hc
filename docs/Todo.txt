MPC-HC:
1) Try to fix all /W3 warnings for Win32 in our code.
   See DSUtil/SharedInclude.h and common.props for the disabled warnings.
   Also a search for "#pragma warning" will reveal any other places where warnings are disabled,
   which shouldn't be a lot in our code.
2) Use the secure CRT functions in our code instead of defining _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
3) Try to clean up the includes; there are a lot of unneeded includes
4) Try to speed up compilation by doing the above and also by optimizing the included headers
   in stdafx.h for mplayerc.vcxproj
5) Reorganize the player's Options
6) Remove support for unneeded renderers
7) Add <UseDebugLibraries>true</UseDebugLibraries> for Debug builds; it's incompatible with /MP
8) Add /Gm for Debug builds; it's incompatible with /MP

FFmpeg:
1) Stop linking ffmpeg statically
2) Compilation fails without -msse
3) Use ffmpeg for:
   * MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 decoding (this would remove the dependency on libmpeg2)
   * FLAC and perhaps AC-3 and DTS decoding (this would remove the dependency on libflac, a52dec and libdca)
Alternatively, drop all internal decoders and filters and intergrate LAVFilters, but keep DXVA1.

Installer:
1) Add detection of directx and run websetup to update if needed or include the needed dx dlls
2) Add file association tasks, see https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/mpc-hc/ticket/2207

VSFilter:
1) Use the defines from Version.h for MPC_COPYRIGHT_STR in VSFilter
2) Define VSFilter's version numbers in a place accessible by its installer and VSFilter itself
3) Build and statically link unrar library for out of the box support of rar'ed subtitles
4) Do we need ISOLATION_AWARE_ENABLED for VSFilter?
