MPC-HC:
1) Try to fix all /W3 warnings for Win32 in our code.
   See DSUtil/SharedInclude.h and common.props for the disabled warnings.
   Also a search for "#pragma warning" will reveal any other places that warnings are disabled
   which shouldn't be a lot in our code.
2) Use the secure CRT functions in our code instead of defining the following in common.props:
   _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS and _SCL_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
3) Try to clean up the includes; there are a lot of unneeded includes
4) Try to speed up compilation by doing the above and also by optimizing the included headers
   in stadafx.h for mplayerc.vcxproj
5) Reorganize the player's Options

FFmpeg:
1) Stop linking ffmpeg statically
2) Compilation fails without -msse
3) Use ffmpeg for:
   * MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 decoding (this would remove the dependency on libmpeg2)
   * FLAC and perhaps AC-3 and DTS decoding (this would remove the dependency on libflac, a52dec and libdca)
Alternatively, drop all internal decoders and filters and intergrate LAVFilters, but keep DXVA1.
