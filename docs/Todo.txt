Patches are always welcome. :)

MPC-HC:
1) Try to fix all /W3 warnings for Win32 in our code.
   A search for "#pragma warning" will reveal any places where warnings are disabled,
   which shouldn't be a lot in our code. (C4731, C4799 etc)
2) Run /analyze and fix some of the errors; memory leaks, NULL pointer dereferencing, buffer overruns etc
   See  http://pastebin.com/TX40Apkw
3) Try to clean up the includes; there are a lot of unneeded includes, or includes which are
   inherited from files they shouldn't be and are not included directly in the files that need them
4) Try to speed up compilation by doing the above and also by optimizing the included headers
   in stdafx.h for mpc-hc.vcxproj.
5) Reorganize the player's Options
6) Remove support for unneeded/obsolete renderers
7) Update Bento4 library or see if we can use ffmpeg for this job
8) Use "new" instead of "DNew" and make sure the leak detection works properly
9) Replace the default old looking toolbar with a more modern one
10) Work around the __mingw_raise_matherr linker error when using /LTCG and MPCHC_LITE
11) Test MSVC 2012 more when it's released. With the RC we get random new errors when building Virtualdub/system.
    With the Beta we got hundreds of redefinitions for the DX headers which seems normal
    since DX is moved into the SDK but we have to use the DX SDK for d3dx9, linking fails if /SAFESEH:NO
    isn't specified (still happens with the RC for Win32) and the MFC bloat workaround does not work as it is
    and unfortunately it is still needed.

MPCIconLib:
1) Rewrite mpciconlib without MFC, so that it's smaller and we no longer
   need any hacks to get the size to normal, see a first patch  http://pastebin.com/EYhrQ2ah
2) Replace the file association icons with better looking ones

FFmpeg:
1) Stop linking ffmpeg statically
2) Compilation fails without -msse, see  http://pastebin.com/zZSUVXkW
3) Use ffmpeg for:
   * MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 decoding (this would remove the dependency on libmpeg2)
   * FLAC and perhaps AC-3 and DTS decoding (this would remove the dependency on libflac, a52dec and libdca)
Alternatively, drop all internal decoders and filters and integrate LAVFilters, but keep DXVA1.

Installer:
1) Add file association tasks, see https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/mpc-hc/ticket/2207

VSFilter:
1) Use the defines from Version.h for MPC_COPYRIGHT_STR in VSFilter
2) Define VSFilter's version numbers in a place accessible by its installer and VSFilter itself
3) Do we need the ISOLATION_AWARE_ENABLED define?
4) Fix the YUV2 bug causing subtitles not to show
5) Backport a few useful patches from those VSFilter forks;  we need individual patches for that
   and we have to make sure that everything works right for mpc-hc itself
