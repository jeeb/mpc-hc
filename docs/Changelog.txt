1.6.2.X - Not released yet
==============================

  created via the keyboard shortcut

* Ticket #734, A unicode encoding will now be used for the ini file. Old ASCII
  ini files will be automatically converted to unicode. Favorites with unicode
  filenames are now correctly handled when using an ini file
* Ticket #1693, [VSFilter] Remove the feature preventing the screensaver from
  running when VSFilter is active since that's a job for players not for filters
* Ticket #1733/#2029, Include subfolders when opening a folder using the command
  line or via the explorer context menu
* Ticket #2144, Improve the subtitles downloader dialog:
    - the dialog's size and position are now saved
    - the columns' sizes are saved
* Ticket #2157, Show the [DXVA] indicator even when playback is paused
* Ticket #2163, Improve the "Save As" dialog: the dialog is updated more regularly and
  the units for the sizes and the speed are now automatically adapted to the values
* Ticket #2165, Improve the "Organize Favorites" dialog:
    - the favorites can now be deleted using the delete key or the backspace key
    - the buttons are disabled when they cannot be used
    - pressing the "Enter" key after selecting a favorite will now start playback
    - multiple selection is now allowed so that more than one favorite can be deleted
      or moved at the same time
    - Ctrl + A will select all items and Ctrl + I inverts the selection.
    - the size and position of the dialog are saved
* Ticket #2216, Show seekbar in compact mode instead of the toolbar since all toolbar
  functions can be accessed easily with keyboard shortcuts
* Ticket #2218, Improve the Go To dialog:
    - use a masked edit for entering the timecode (hh:mm:ss.ms or mm:ss.ms depending on
      the file duration)
    - show an error message when the entered timecode is greater than the file duration
* Reduced the maximum number of packets in the Queue, except for AVI. This will
  reduce the amount of memory consumed by the player
* Improved the "Open directory" dialog: the checkbox will now use only one line
  when possible and the overall dialog will look better when using XP
* Avoid using negative option in the Tweaks page: change "Don't use 'search in folder'
  on commands 'Skip back/forward' when only one item in playlist" into "Open next/previous
  file in folder on 'Skip back/forward' when there is only one item in playlist".
* The minidump feature is now enabled by default. The crash dialog has been updated to
  redirect the users to the bug tracker

  effect on any "modern" OS (>= Windows XP)

     stream) the wrong label was grayed out
